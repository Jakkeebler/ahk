# <> Release 2.3.1.2

###### **_Please note: in this changelog I will be linking to commits, these commits might not be the latest version of said code as things are changing all the time and adding dates would get incredibly confusing, don't copy/paste from these linked commits, check out the current version of the code in the script files themselves._**

## > Functions
- Added `switchToDisc()` to swap to or open discord

## > My Scripts
- Added a hotkey to [replace highlighted text](https://bit.ly/3ot2YiC) with all caps
- Moved the hotkey to Pause from `autosave.ahk` -> `My Scripts.ahk` so that I can actually remind the user it is paused

### > Other Changes
- Removed the reminder in `autosave.ahk` as it made it impossible to unpause the script
- Added `focusChat.ahk` to focus my chat window using my streamdeck
