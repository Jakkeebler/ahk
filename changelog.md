# <> Release 2.5.1 - HotkeyReplacer.ahk -> KSA + settings.ini
## HotkeyReplacer.ahk
With this release `HotkeyReplacer.ahk` will also replace `Keyboard Shortcuts.ini` entries with the users custom entries. This change allows for a more seamless move between versions for the user as no more manual tinkering is necessary to get up and running (unless you use `QMK Keyboard.ahk`. There are no plans to add `QMK Keyboard.ahk` to `HotkeyReplacer.ahk` due to it being so highly specific to the keyboard layout of the user).

## settings.ini
Also included in this release is a new `settings.ini` file that is autogenerated in `A_MyDocuments \tomshi\` and acts as a central file to store all data points/settings needed by my scripts to properly function.
- All instances of `yes/no` replaced with `true/false`
- All old files/dirs used to track things like; `firstCheck()`, `updateCheck()`, `adobeTemp()`, `locationReplace()`, `tooltips - autosave.ahk` will be automatically deleted and replaced with the new `settings.ini`

# â—‡ Further Changelog

## > Functions
- `discUnread()` now shows the proper tooltip depending on if it can't find any servers/channels
- Add default values to `valuehold()` and `manInput()`

`audioDrag()`
- Will now always send an `errorLog()` if the right colour was found instead of only on loop `2 & 3`
- Added more colours

`moveTab()` 
- Will now set the `monitor` variable to one of the two I wish to cycle between if the function is activated on a monitor that isn't included in the cycle
- Fixed a bug that would cause the function to cycle endlessly
- Fixed a bug that would cause a tab to sometimes not join another browser window
- Changed `MouseMove()` speed from `3 -> 2`
- Will now return the mouse to the original coords if moving a tab from `monitor 4 -> 2` but not the other way around

`toolCust()`
- `timeout` variable will now default to `1000 (1s)` and may be omitted
    - All `timeout` variables still containing `""` have been swapped for just integers

## > My Scripts
`SC03A & c::`
- Will now attempt to determine whether to capitilise or completely lowercase the highlighted text depending on which is more frequent
- Fixed a bug that caused the hotkey to ignore any text in quotation marks
- Removed `SC03A & v::` as it is now redundant
- Will now prompt the user if the highlighted string is too long before continuing

## > QMK Keyboard
- Fixed `p::`
- Moved `"^+1"` to `KSA` value
- `newWin()` now uses `getHotkeys()` to remove a required variable
- Pressing "Cancel" for `b::` will now properly cancel the entire hotkey

## > Other Changes
- `replaceChecklist.ahk` can now replace the users `checklist.ini` file for each working dir to allow modification of the necessary .ini values without causing issues
    - Users running versions of `checklist.ini` below `v2.3` (release v2.5) will no longer need to manually adjust their .ini files. This script will generate the proper .ini file automatically
    - Will backup the local copy of `checklist.ini` to a `\backups` folder

`vscode()`
- Updated `collapse.png`
- Updated `explorer2.png` so the function will now work even if you have an unsaved file

`autosave.ahk`
- Removed redundant variables from `timeRemain()` function
- `tooltips` variable now reads an `.ini` file in `A_MyDocuments \tomshi\settings.ini` instead of an adjustable variable in the script itself
