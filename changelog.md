# <> Release 2.14.0.1 - Hotfix
- This version fixes an incorrect assumption that Premiere `v24.3` would include UI changes which resulted in a folder existing that shouldn't.

> [!Caution]
> If the user has already installed Release `v2.14` of this repo, and does not migrate to this version, they may encounter issues with a few scripts that search for the `Proxy` icon within Premiere. Other than that nothing else should be affected.

- Fixed `vidSelect.ahk` no longer working
