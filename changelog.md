# <> Release 2.3.1.4

###### **_Please note: in this changelog I will be linking to commits, these commits might not be the latest version of said code as things are changing all the time and adding dates would get incredibly confusing, don't copy/paste from these linked commits, check out the current version of the code in the script files themselves._**

## > Functions
- `valuehold()` will no longer work with "any" value panel length and is now hard coded. Allowing it to work across a broader length made it unreliable and more likely to grab the incorrect value. While I do try to make as many functions as possible as flexible as possible, when it comes to this specific function, accuracy is far more important

## > My Scripts
- `Alt & p` macro has been updated to work with latest win11 update
- `SC03A & v` macro given more logic as it would constantly fail on first use

## > Other Changes
