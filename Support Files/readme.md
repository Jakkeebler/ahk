# info
This directory is here simply to *assist* other scripts.

- `\images` contains any images scripts use in them (eg. for a gui)
- `Fkeys used.xlsx` is an excel file keeping track of where `Fkeys` beyond `F12` are being used
- `ignore.ini` is for the update checker to know if you want to be prompted or not
- `mouse settings.png` is just a backup of my mouse settings

*note:* in a recent version of LGHUB (2022/03/26), the `WheelLeft/WheelRight` buttons were either changed on purpose or broken on accident so that if you hold them, they spam their inputs. As such, I have had to replace them with `F21/F23` respectively. If logitech ever revert this change, I will as well but as there isn't any way to revert their software, this is all I can do for now to maintain proper functionality of my scripts
