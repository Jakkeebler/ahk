# info
This directory is here simply to *assist* other scripts.

- `\Icons` contains all the icon files for all my scripts
- `\images` contains any images scripts use in them (eg. for a gui)
- `\ImageSearch` contains all `.png` files for any `ImageSearch` used within any of my scripts
- `\qmk keyboard images` contains all the files I use to make little cutouts for my secondary keyboard
- `\Release Assets` is a folder containing all scripts necessary for the user to have a clean installation experience of my repo
- `\Secondary Keyboard Files` contains all files I need to make my secondary keyboard work within my workflow
- `\shortcuts` contains all shortcut files I use within scripts
- `\textreplace` is a symlink to my `textreplace` repo and will get updated periodically on new releases of this repo. If you want the most up to date version of this script, clone that repo instead
- `Fkeys used.xlsx` is an excel file keeping track of where `Fkeys` beyond `F12` are being used
- `mouse settings.png` is just a backup of my mouse settings

*note:* in a recent version of LGHUB (2022/03/26), the `WheelLeft/WheelRight` buttons were either changed on purpose or broken on accident so that if you hold them, they spam their inputs. As such, I have had to replace them with `F21/F23` respectively. If logitech ever revert this change, I will as well but as there isn't any way to revert their software, this is all I can do for now to maintain proper functionality of my scripts
