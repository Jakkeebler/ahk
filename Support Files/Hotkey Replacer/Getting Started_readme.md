Hi there! welcome to Tomshi's ahk scripts!

If this is your first time downloading my scripts, move the release `.exe` wherever you wish and then run it to extract my repo! If you run the `.exe` from the directory you intend on leaving my repo, then make sure to press `Yes` when the message box prompts you about creating a Symlink. If you don't do this (AND if you ever move my repo) you will need to manually run `..\Support Files\CreateSymLink.ahk` to regenerate that symlink. After all that, try running `My Scripts.ahk` to get started!

If you HAVE downloaded my scripts before, run the installer `.exe` in a secondary folder and then go to `..\Support Files\Hotkey Replacer\` and run `HotkeyReplacer.ahk` and point it towards your original directory (ensuring your copy of `My Scripts.ahk` is still named as such and that your `Keyboard Shortcuts.ini` file is still in the correct place). The script will then check to see if you've changed any of the hotkeys in `My Scripts.ahk` as well as any of the shortcuts in `Keyboard Shortcuts.ini` and replace the release versions of each with your custom hotkeys/shortcuts!. From there you can just delete your old original directory and replace it with the second one.

A backup of the original release versions of `My Scripts.ahk` & `Keyboard Shortcuts.ini` will be saved in `\Backups\` just incase something goes wrong.

Windows Defender might have a red hot complain about the `v2.x-.exe` file (even after you've used it) and attempt to remove it. It's a compiled version of my scripts, alongside the `SevenZip.ahk` lib by `thqby` to allow me to include the repo in a .zip file that then gets automatically extracted when you run the release .exe ^.^
