Hi there! welcome to Tomshi's ahk scripts!

If this is your first time downloading my scripts, simply ignore the `HotkeyReplacer.ahk` file and move the release folder wherever you wish (and feel free to rename it!). Then try running `My Scripts.ahk` to get started!

If you have downloaded my scripts before, run the installer script and point it towards your directory (ensuring your copy of `My Scripts.ahk` is still named as such and that your `Keyboard Shortcuts.ini` file is still in the correct place). The installer script will then check to see if you've changed any of the hotkeys in `My Scripts.ahk` as well as any of the shortcuts in `Keyboard Shortcuts.ini` and replace the release versions of each with your custom hotkeys/shortcuts!.

A backup of the original release versions of `My Scripts.ahk` & `Keyboard Shortcuts.ini` will be saved in `\releasefolder\Backups\` just incase something goes wrong.

Windows Defender might have a red hot complain about the `v2.x-.exe` file (even after you've used it) and attempt to remove it. It's a compiled version of my scripts, alongside the `SevenZip.ahk` lib by `thqby` to allow me to include the repo in a .zip file that then gets automatically extracted when you run the release .exe ^.^
