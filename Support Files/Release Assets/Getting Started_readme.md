Hi there! welcome to Tomshi's ahk scripts! (`..\` stands for the root directory of my repo that you just extracted!)

If this is your first time downloading my scripts and you just ran the `.exe` file in a location you don't want it to be no worries! Just move the release `.exe` wherever you wish and then run it again to extract my repo in the proper destination!

After running the release `.exe` you will be prompted with a GUI to select a few options on install:
___

**Symlink:**

Will create a symlink between ``A_MyDocuments \AutoHotkey\`` & the ``..\lib\`` folder in these scripts. This symlink is essential for correct opperation but only needs to be created once (or if the user moves the repo to a new directory)

**note: selecting this option will ask for a script to be launched elevated, this is necessary as cmd needs to be elevated to create symlinks. This option should also not be selected if the current directory is not the final destination for this repo*
___

**Hotkey Replacer:**

Will produce a GUI that will allow the user to replace any hotkeys (in `My Scripts.ahk`) and KSA.ini values in this release with their own.

A backup of the original release versions of `My Scripts.ahk` & `Keyboard Shortcuts.ini` will be saved in `\Backups\` just incase something goes wrong.

**note: selecting this option is only necessary if the user has an older version of my scripts already in use*

___

**Run at Startup:**
Will create a shortcut of `PC Startup.ahk` (`..\PC Startup\PC Startup.ahk`) in the user's startup folder `C:\Users\A_UserName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`. This can be disabled/reenabled later in `settingsGUI()` (`#F1` by default)

___

If you choose to ignore this install step and wish to run these files at a later time, they can be located;
Symlink:            `..\Support Files\Release Assets\CreateSymLink.ahk`
Hotkey Replacer:    `..\Support Files\Release Assets\HotkeyReplacer.ahk`
PC Startup:         `..\PC Startup\PC Startup.ahk`

Windows Defender might have a red hot complain about the `v2.x-.exe` file (even after you've used it) and attempt to remove it. It's a compiled version of my scripts, alongside the `SevenZip.ahk` lib by `thqby` to allow me to include the repo in a .zip file that then gets automatically extracted when you run the release .exe ^.^
