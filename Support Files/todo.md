> This list is mainly for tasks I intend on completing before the next release and is only meant to remind me to do certain little things. For any more major planned changes, reference the [Upcoming Changes](https://github.com/users/Tomshiii/projects/1) page

## General
- [x] `ptf` reading `Premiere_UIA.ahk` classes should attempt to fallback to the closest Year version if an updated one cannot be found (ie. updating to `v23.6` shouldn't throw because class `23_6` doesn't exist)
- [ ] is autosave counting moving the mouse as activity..??

## Functions
- [ ] make numpad gain func use a timer and allow a second number to be pressed
    - [ ] maybe make <kbd>Enter<kbd> finish the timer early so it can have a good amount of time to accept the second input
- [ ] make open proj script optionally open a custom dir (ie back a dir or forward a dir)

## Streamdeck
- [ ] change icon for download to proj to show that it's for videos
    - [ ] make one for audio too
