> This list is mainly for tasks I intend on completing before the next release and is only meant to remind me to do certain little things. For any more major planned changes, reference the [Upcoming Changes](https://github.com/users/Tomshiii/projects/1) page

## general
- [x] alt menu accell script seems to interfere in ae during things like roto brush
- [ ] add a `make sequence` streamdeck script & have it focus the project window first so that it only continues to increment (or see if it's possible to focus the individual bin)
