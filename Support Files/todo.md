> This list is mainly for tasks I intend on completing before the next release and is only meant to remind me to do certain little things. For any more major planned changes, reference the [Upcoming Changes](https://github.com/users/Tomshiii/projects/1) page

## Functions
- [x] open adobe proj func not working if any explorer window already open
- [x] right clicking in the prem program monitor appears to hang everything. ~~is it bc of right click prem?~~ nope. just premiere being dumb
- [ ] autosave saving sometimes causes changing of sequence (clicking RButton at the same time?)
- [ ] wait for timeline focus func seems to cause endless loop failing to focus the timeline
- [ ] qmk keyboard funcs on first use sometimes still swapping to other sequence
- [ ] prev/next keyframe sometimes swapping sequences

## General
- [x] fix margin button swapping between open sequences

`adobe fullscreen check`
- [x] throws when prem not responding
