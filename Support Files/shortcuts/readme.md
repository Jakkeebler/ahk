## About
This folder is just a collection of the shortcuts that get called by a few scripts instead of using hardcoded filepaths.

If you are simply cloning the repo from github instead of downloading a release, this folder will be empty. A lot of my scripts rely on some of these shortcuts to exist. So either consider downloading a release to grab them or create them yourself.

The important ones are;
- Adobe Premiere Pro
- Adobe After Effects
- Adobe Photoshop
- The `Your Phone` application from microsoft
