# <> Release 2.0 - Official Release of AHK v2.0 compliant scripts

It's been mentioned in previous releases but this is it, the official ahk v2.0 version of my scripts. It's been what has felt like months trying to improve on these scripts adding more features and tidying up the whole experience. 
_**// This release will ONLY work in AHK v2.0 and will NOT work in AHK v1.1. Make sure you have the correct version of AHK //**_

## What's new?
_**// This release is NOT just a ahk v2.0 rewrite of [release 1.2](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/releases/tag/v1.2), there are about 30-40 commits worth of extra work since that release //**_
- _**v2.0 branch merged into dev/main**_ 
- AHK v2.0 syntaxing for all scripts
- Additional functions in MS_Functions.ahk
- Some new macros here and there
- New icons for some scripts
- Updates to the Resolve script
