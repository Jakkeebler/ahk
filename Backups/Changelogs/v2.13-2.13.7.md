# <> Release 2.13.0 - QOL Changes
- `Keyboard Shortcuts.ini` has been moved from `..\lib\KSA\` => `..\Support Files\KSA\`
    - This should allow the user to more easily, manually update their entire `..\lib\` folder without worrying about `KSA.ini` getting wiped in the process
> ##### *It should be noted that this change does not protect the user in the event that a new `KSA` variable is added. It will need to be manually added back by the user or they will have to go through the usual update steps.*
- `dirs.ini` has been added to `..\Support Files\Streamdeck Files\` which will allow the user to store directories specific to `Streamdeck AHK` in one location
    - This should allow the user to more easily, manually update their entire `..\Streamdeck AHK` folder without worrying that any custom directories set are going to be wiped

## > Functions
- Added `editScript()`
- Fixed `ytdlp().handleDownload()` not handling outlier scenario where a `.mkv` is generated
- Fixed `prem.getTimeline()` incorrectly calculating timeline coordinates
- Removed references to `7zip.ahk` from `startup.libUpdateCheck()` as the script has been pulled by `thqby`
- `rbuttonPrem().movePlayhead()` now accepts optional param `allChecks` and allows the user to call `movePlayhead()` even if the cursor is hovering over a video/audio track
- `checkStuck()` now accepts optional param `arr` to pass in a custom array of buttons to check
- `errorLog()` will now check for, and strip the `err.what` string of the passed in error object of the word `Prototype.` to make resulting logs easier to read
- Code taken from `settingsGUI()` to add `generateAdobeShortcut()`
- `getHTML()` will now check the resulting string for error messages
- `mouseDrag()` will now delay slightly between inputs to reduce the number of times the function is too fast for the desired input
- `encodeGUI {` now offers the option of setting a `bitrate` value instead of a `crf` value
- `ffmpeg.reencode_h26x()` now accepts parameter `bitrate` if the user wishes to define a bitrate value instead of a `crf` value. Note: only one can be used at a time and the other **must** be set to false

`startup {`
- `adobeTemp()` will no longer run if `Premiere` or `After Effects` is currently open
- `trayMen()` now offers option to open `Premiere_UIA.ahk`

`switchTo`
- `Premiere()` & `AE()` will now;
    - Check for the existence of `Creative Cloud` and attempt to open it before proceeding
        - Both functions now also accept parameter `openCC` to determine if this behaviour is desired. It is set to `true` by default
    - Attempt to generate a shortcut (using values set within `settingsGUI()`) if one isn't detected

## > hCrop
Added a series of scripts designed to split a video in half along the horizontal axis
- Added `hCropGui.ahk`      - to extend off `encodeGUI {` and provide a few more options for some of the below scripts
- Added `hCropLoop.ahk`     - to split in half all `.mkv` files in a directory and output to two new files
- Added `hCrop OnlyCam.ahk` - to produce a GUI allowing the user to select only one half of all `.mkv` files in a selected directory to be output to a new file
- Added `hCrop Single.ahk`  - to split in half a single selected file

## > autosave.ahk
- No longer backs up project files when the user manually saves with <kbd>Ctrl + s</kbd> to help mitigate the backup folders inflating to giant sizes during long projects
- Checking if the user has interacted with the mouse before proceeding with a save attempt can now be toggled within `settingsGUI()`

## > Other Changes
- Added `v24` Premiere template
- Added `nameof.ahk` by `thqby`
- Added `deleteDotUnderscore.ahk` to delete annoying macOS files from a directory
- Added `audSelect.ahk` & `vidSelect.ahk` as additional `..\Streamdeck AHK\download\` scripts to offer the same functionality but the user gets to decide the final file destination before the script begins
- Fixed `Move Project.ahk` throwing when it attempts to delete a `Backups` folder
- Fixed `tiktok project.ahk` not using the selected resoltion
- Fixed `gameCheck.ahk` being unable to call the GUI from the tray menu
- Updated `UIA` lib

# <> Release 2.13.1 - Hotfix

## > Functions
- Added `ffmpeg.extractAudio()` to extract all audio streams from a file
    - Added `extractAudio.ahk` streamdeck script
- Fixed `generateAdobeShortcut()` throwing when called from `settingsGUI()`
- Fixed `WinGet.WinMonitor()` throwing when unable to determine the position of the passed in window
- Fixed `cmd.result()` not producing a result if the return value was instead sent to the error stream
- `ffmpeg.all_XtoY()` now accepts parameter `frameRate` to determine what framerate you want the remux to obide by. This can help stop scenarios like a `60fps` file getting remuxed to `60.0002fps` which in turn helps with performance issues within NLE's like Premiere
    > `all_XtoY()` will attempt to determine a file's framerate using `ffmpeg` but if it fails/the result isn't an integer, it will use the passed in value

`prem {`
- Added `delayPlayback()` to delay playback after a ripple trim
    - Added `prem.rippleTrim()` to support this function

> This change will result in `HotkeyReplacer.ahk` no longer functioning as intended. It has been disabled for now until a replacement is written.

## > Other Changes
- Fixed `audSelect.ahk` & `vidSelect.ahk` not functioning
- Added `..\Streamdeck AHK\screenshots\` scripts
- Added `genProjDirs()` to cut repeat code in a couple of `Streamdeck AHK` scripts

# <> Release 2.13.4 - Bugfix
There are still a few notable things I wanted to add/change before pushing another release but I feel the amount of things fixed has begun to get too high to continue delaying it. Being busy with work has just continued to make it difficult to work on any of the larger issues/projects.

## > Functions
- Fixed `cmd.Result()` failing to provide a result under certain conditions
- Fixed `reencodeGUI()` not focusing opened destination window correctly if it is already open
- Fixed `editScript()` silently failing if registry value came back blank

    - Added `unread()`
    - Added `button()`
- `switchTo.adobeProject()` will now copy the project path to the user's clipboard if they instead activate the function twice in rapid succession
- `refreshWin()` can now define whether the program is run elevated
- `rbuttonPrem().movePlayhead()` will now first check to ensure the main `Premiere` window is the active window before anything else. This should help mitigate the function retrieving incorrect timeline coordinates if another window is currently stealing focus
- `move.winCenter()` now accepts parameter `adjustWidth`

`ffmpeg {`
- `all_HCrop()` => `all_Crop()`
    - Now has added option to define whether to crop horizontally or vertically
    - Will now include `.mp4` files
    - Cropped videos will be placed in a folder labelled `crop_loop_output`
- `extractAudio()` will now place extracted audio streams in dir named after the file

`Prem {`
- Fixed `screenshot()` throwing under certain conditions
- Fixed `gain()` focusing the cancel button due to `Premiere` changing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> order
- Fixed `prem.wheelEditPoint()` having difficulties trying to select previous/next keyframes
- Fixed `reset()` failing

## Streamdeck AHK
- Fixed `audSelect.ahk` & `vidSelect.ahk` still failing under certain conditions
- Added `extractAll.ahk`
    - `extractAudio.ahk` renamed => `extractSingle.ahk`
    - Both moved to `..\Streamdeck AHK\extract audio\`
- Added `vCrop` scripts to split clips vertically
    - `hCropGUI` => `cropGUI`
- Added `Change.ahk` screenshot script to set a new starting value
- `..\download\` scripts now pass `--recode-video mp4` instead of using `ytdlp().handleDownload()` to automatically reencode any files to `.mp4`

## > Other Changes
- Fixed `autosave.ahk` not respecting `beep` setting
- Fixed `CreateSymLink.ahk` failing to operate on the correct path
- Fixed `generateAdobeSym.ahk` requiring a dependacy. This script is expected to run before symlinks and as such should have none
- Removed lingering `checklist wait` setting from `settingsGUI`

.

# <> Release 2.13.5 - Bugfix

## > Functions
- Fixed `prem.selectionTool()` failing to fall back to keyboard shortcuts if the image cannot be found
- Fixed `errorLog()` throwing if only one tooltip coordinate is passed
- Attempt to fix `discord.surround()` always failing and forcing `ClipWait` to time out. (Still sometimes delayed.. dealing with the clipboard is annoying)

- `WinGet.ExplorerPath()` now uses code by `lexikos` to correctly function with win11 explorer tabs

`ytdlp {`
- `download()`
    - Will now work with `facebook`, `instagram` & `reddit` links

`extract audio`
- `extractAll.ahk` will now check to see if [Bulk Audio Extract Tool](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/BulkAudioExtractTool) is installed before proceeding.
- Both scripts will now attempt to default the `FileSelect` window to the current directory (if win explorer is the active window)

`download` scripts;

- All scripts now pass `--windows-filenames`

`reencode`
- `reencode.ahk` => `reencode_h264.ahk`
- Added `proresGUI.ahk`
    - Added `reencode_prores.ahk` & `reencode_prores_all.ahk`

Renamed;
- `SD_ptf {` => `SD_Opt {`

# <> Release 2.13.7 - Stability Fixes

## > Functions
- `cmd.result()` now accepts parameter `hide` and can launch the cmd window hidden
    - Added `pipeCommand()` to allow for this possibility. Acknowledgements for this function can be found in the `..\lib\Other\` directory.
- Added `__getChannels()` to `ffmpeg()` to determine audio channels present within the given file
- Fixed a bug in `clip.copyWait()` that caused it to send an empty variable to `copy.wait()` instead of `unset` if its first parameter was left blank
    - This caused `copy.wait()` to assign a blank variable to the clipboard instead of doing nothing
- Fixed `switchTo.closeOtherWindow()` failing to close all `explorer` windows if one or more contain multiple tabs

`settingsGUI()`
- Fixed `Adobe` settings generating incorrect values
- `Adobe` settings will now only present the user with versions of `Premiere` & `After Effects` that they have installed. `Photoshop` will show any versions they have installed +- 1 as their numbering system is a bit weird and I have no intention of keeping a catelogue of what version relates to which year

## > autosave.ahk
- Script should now be better at determining if `rbuttonPrem()` is active which should result in less cuts on the timeline
- Fixed failing to reactive the original window if a save attempt was made

## > Other Changes
- Fixed `generateAdobeSym.ahk` silently failing if build command got too long
- Fixed `Hours Worked` in `checklist.ahk` showing incorrectly unless the timer has stopped
- Added `selectFollowPlayhead.ahk`

- Rewrote `tiktok project.ahk` to utilise a class
