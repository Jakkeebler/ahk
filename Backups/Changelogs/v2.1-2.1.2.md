###### **_Please note: in this changelog I will be linking to commits, these commits might not be the latest version of said code as things are changing all the time and adding dates would get incredibly confusing, don't copy/paste from these linked commits, check out the current version of the code in the script files themselves._**

# ImageSearch and PixelSearch
This release brings the addition of [ImageSearch](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/commands/ImageSearch.htm) & [PixelSearch](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/commands/PixelSearch.htm) to some scripts to make things more accurate and less prone to breaking when a window shifts by a few pixels. The purpose of Release 2.1 is to replace as many raw pixel coords with either ImageSearches or PixelSearches, especially within Premiere as any slight adjustments in your workspace can have cascading negative effects.

- Premiere macros updated to include ImageSearches for;
    - [Drag video in preview window]((https://git.io/JEInE)) script now uses ImageSearch and [drag x/y, scale, and rotation] now use a combination of ImageSearch and PixelSearch to click the right places and latch onto the right text as well as well as using ImageSearch when you tap to then press the reset button next to the respective value you're adjusting instead of inputting numbers
    - [num()](https://git.io/JEInV) function now uses ImageSearch and PixelSearch to ensure less random inputs being sent through the program that breaks random things.
    - [[Press Selection tool while typing]](https://git.io/JEInQ) macro now uses ImageSearch instead of pixel values as Premiere Workspaces love to just randomly move around
    - [[!t text script]](https://git.io/JE96Q) now uses ImageSearch to cut out all raw pixel coords and also speeds up the macro to be near instant
- [Resolve Script](https://git.io/JEInN) updated to include ImageSearches for;
    - Making sure the video panel itself is active
    - Horizontal/Vertical flips
    - Drag and drop effects
    - F1-F5 Scripts - Uses ImageSearch to check for;
        - The Effects window being activated
        - The sidebar being open
        - Your desired drop down being selected
        - The search button to instantly start typing
- Addition of some Discord functions in [MS_Functions.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/v2.1/MS_functions.ahk#L105)
    - Click on any discord button within the right click context menu by using an ImageSearch
- Addition of some Photoshop functions to [MS_Functions.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/v2.1/MS_functions.ahk#L402)
    - [Adds support for "x/y, scale & rotation" drag style functions](https://git.io/JEInj) - all powered by ImageSearch

You'll see code blocks similar to this in a few places now;
```autohotkey
If ImageSearch(&x, &y, 0, 911,705, 1354, "*2 " A_WorkingDir "\ImageSearch\Premiere\scale.png")
	MouseMove(%&x%, %&y%)
else
    {
        code()
    }
```
```autohotkey
 If PixelSearch(&xcol, &ycol, %&x%, %&y%, %&x% + "740", %&y% + "40", 0x288ccf, 3)
	MouseMove(%&xcol%, %&ycol%)
```

# Secondary QMK Keyboard
This release brings along the addition of [QMK Keyboard.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/dev/QMK%20Keyboard.ahk) which along with the [Hasu USB-USB converter](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=109514.0) allows you to use a second keyboard to launch completely different scripts than your main keyboard following [this tutorial by Taran from LTT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZEoss4XIgc). Any macros that will be moved to this script will be defined in [MS_Functions](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/v2.1/MS_functions.ahk#L871) which can then be pulled out and placed in your own scripts without any issues.

Things moved to the secondary keyboard include:
- Auto Launch/Swap to: [[explorer/premiere]](https://git.io/JEIcI) macros
- Premiere: [[Drag video in preview window & drag x/y, scale, and rotation]](https://git.io/JEIcI) macros to adjust values while held/reset when pressed
- Old Numpad 1-3 Premiere: [[Numpad1-3 Gain Macros]](https://git.io/JEIc2)
- Old Numpad 7-9 Premiere: [[Numpad7-9 Punch In Macros]](https://git.io/JEIc6)

Over time things will continue to be added to this secondary keyboard (like the [[photoshop functions]](https://git.io/JEIc1)), this release just brings initial support and the moving of a few scripts to kick it all off.

# Other Changes

## > Fkey auto launch.ahk removed
All of its functionality has been [ported over to MS_Functions](https://git.io/JEIc7). It is simply easier to keep track of there and allows me to easily change what buttons do what by defining them as functions over there, then assigning those functions to buttons in their respective scripts.

## > MS_Functions
- [Changed variable names](https://git.io/JEICJ) for almost everything to allow for clearer communication of what each variable is
    - All functions now contain comments explaining every variable
- Added [coordc()](https://git.io/JEICG) for caret coord mode
- Update [timeline()](https://git.io/JEICR) to pass more variables to allow for defining the timeline region itself so the mouse won't warp unless you're actually within the timeline.
- Added [all functionality from Fkey auto launch.ahk](https://git.io/JEIc7) to allow for easy swapping of keys, and less repeat code across multiple scripts
- Removed all instances of &button, [replaced with A_ThisHotkey](https://git.io/JEICr)
- Added [toolFind()](https://git.io/JE7eh) & [toolCust()](https://git.io/JE7eh) to easily add tooltips to diagnose problems
- Added a section for [QMK Keyboard](https://git.io/JEaGk) which allows me to just define everything as a function so the main script remains as readable as possible
    - Added [gain()](https://git.io/JuIEa)
    - Added [gainSecondary()](https://git.io/JE7tX) to open up the gain menu for manual input. The benefit of this function is that it ensures the timeline is in focus and a clip is selected
    - Now uses [[ControlGetClassNN]](https://git.io/JE7tr) to ensure the timeline is in focus as well as ImageSearch to ensure a clip is selected so there's less chances of inputs being sent through to the wrong places
- Added [vscode()](https://git.io/JExUN) to help me navigate between my scripts quickly within VSCode
#### Premiere
- Update [num()](https://git.io/JEICO) function to pass more parameters to cut repeat code
- Added [valuehold()](https://git.io/JEICC) to cut down repeat code within the scale, x/y & rotation macros
    - Added more logic to find the [value you want to adjust](https://git.io/JEInE) (using ImageSearch), then finds the blue pixel colour of the value you want to adjust using a PixelSearch that's specifically to the right of the value you want to adjust
    - Added more logic to use [ImageSearch](https://git.io/JEIC8) to find the reset button to the right of the value you're adjusting
    - Added functionality to allow use while [keyframing](https://git.io/JEZjl)
- Added [audioDrag()](https://git.io/JuHNa) to drag my bleep sfx (or any sfx you want) to the timeline from the media browser. (don't use the project window, the project window's search bar as well as the window itself is practically useless for macros)
#### Photoshop
- Added [psProp()](https://git.io/JEIC6) that adds support for "x/y, scale & rotation" drag style functions
- Added [psSave()](https://git.io/JuVCn) that allows you to speed up the twitch emote saving process
#### Resolve
- Added [rvalhold()](https://git.io/JEVQy) to cut repeat code in the resolve script
    - Added additional ImageSearch to check if the Inspector tab is open
    - Added additional ImageSearch to find the value you want to adjust - less raw pixel values
- Changed [Rfav()] -> [REffect()](https://git.io/JEwIP)
    - Now Passes more variables to allow for more flexibility
    - No more raw pixel values
    - Searches for the effect you want instead of needing to favourite it
    - Completely uses ImageSearch
- Added [rflip()](https://git.io/JuIBu) to reduce repeat code in the Resolve script

## > Other Tweaks

- Addition of [[Streaming.ahk]](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/v2.1/Streaming.ahk) which allows for obs to be run in admin mode while retaining ahk interactions
- Addition of [[PC Startup.ahk]](https://git.io/JE2Ms) to deal with some actions that are executed on computer startup to minimise the need for me to do manually.
- Addition of [[Start new project.ahk]](https://git.io/JuHNp) to create a folder tree for new editing projects
- Addition of [[Move project.ahk]](https://git.io/JuHNb) to move 1 folder -> to another place
- Add [#Requires](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/commands/_Requires.htm) to all scripts so attempting to run in a non compatible version of ahk spits back an error
- Fixed ["Google Search Highlighted Text"](https://git.io/JEICy). Turns out it wasn't working in ahk v2.0, an oversight on my part
- Added a macro to [open the AHK documentation](https://git.io/JEKto)
    - And a macro to [Search Highlighted text in the AHK documentation](hhttps://git.io/JEKtM)
- Added a macro to [click on the scale value in Premiere to allow manual value entry](https://git.io/JEICd)
    - [Turns off other hotkeys](https://git.io/Juizg) on the secondary numpad to allow me to input said manual values with the same hand
- [[Drag and drop effect presets]](https://git.io/JEIcp) in premiere now moves the mouse to the [caret position](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/commands/CaretGetPos.htm) instead of a fixed pixel value to make it less prone to breaking
- Added a macro to [pull out the project window](https://git.io/JEKTx) in premiere and move it to my second monitor (adobe refuses to save its position in my workspace)
- Changed [#Include](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/commands/_Include.htm) as apparently it doesn't need a full filepath to work
- Added a [gaussian blur hotkey](https://git.io/JEICj) to Photoshop
- Added [SetScrollLockState](https://git.io/JEIWU) similar to num/capslock
- Updated Adobe/Streamdeck backups
- Added [A_PriorHotkey](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/Variables.htm#PriorHotkey) and [A_PriorKey](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/Variables.htm#PriorKey) to [all available scripts](https://git.io/JEKow) to stop AHK from spamming macros
- Changed it so that [swap to/open _x program_](https://git.io/JEoWL) can work even while premiere is open now that all the hotkeys I would use for them have been moved to the second keyboard
- Added [[convert mkv to mp4.ahk]](https://git.io/JEKxy) as a streamdeck launch script
- Added a macro to [move back 1 folder](https://git.io/JEHIv) in a folder tree in windows explorer
- Added a macro to [accelerate scrolling](https://git.io/Juc4h)
- Updated a few [[Streamdeck AHK]](https://git.io/JuVIU) scripts to improve reliability and cut out raw pixel coords

# Changes
## > MS_Functions
- Addition of [switchToYourPhone()](https://git.io/JuNIx) to swap to or open the Your Phone Application in windows
- Lowered the [sleep value](https://git.io/JzlxK) in valuehold() from 100 -> 50.
- Fixed the disabling/reenabling of [Numpad hotkeys](https://git.io/JzlpO) as it would end up spitting out the respective Numpad Button as well as your usual macro when pressed after use
    - Added [hotkeyDeactivate()/hotkeyReactivate()](https://git.io/JzlpO) to cut repeat code across manual entry macros
    - Added hotkey disabling/reenabling to [gainSecondary()](https://git.io/JzlpB)

- Moved all of my shortcuts to [\shortcuts](https://git.io/JuNL2) and now include them in the repo
- Small bugfix to the [pull out the project window](https://git.io/JzLHB) macro to fix an error that would occur if it didn't find the first image
- Made LioranBoard [run from its own directory](https://git.io/JzL73) within my [start main stream.ahk] script to stop it from regenerating the connect.ini file in the "\Streamdeck AHK" folder every stream. Would be pretty awkward to forget to delete that file before releasing this
- Added some mouse macros to [move windows around](https://git.io/JzmRy)
- Made the [WheelLeft/Right premiere macros](https://git.io/Jzlpr) focus the timeline
