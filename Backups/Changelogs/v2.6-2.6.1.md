# <> Release 2.6 - Dark Mode (sorta) + Two New Scripts + Structure Overhaul
This release brings along two new scripts; `gameCheck.ahk` & `Multi-Instance Close.ahk`

- `gameCheck.ahk` is a script that will automatically detect when a predetermined game is currently active and suspend `My Scripts.ahk`. This is important because `My Scripts.ahk` contains a bunch of macros that really don't play nice to games and cause a lot of basic functionality in them to break. This script will also detect when the game is no longer the active window and unsuspend `My Scripts.ahk`. Games may be periodically added to this script but feel welcome to add your own list!
- `Multi-Instance Close.ahk` is a script that will periodically check for duplicate instances of any autohotkey scripts and close one of them. Even if you use `#SingleInstance Force` reloading scripts can sometimes cause a second instance to slip open. This script will hopefully mitigate the odd behaviour that occurs when this happens by closing any duplicates.

Alongside those two scripts, this update brings along a dark theme to certain GUI elements. AHK is rather limited in what it can apply in a modern way but a global dark mode option can now be enabled in `settingsGUI()`

# > Other Big Changes
- Completely redesigned `checklist.ahk` to run from the root dir instead of copying it to the project location
    - *Opening an old, inuse version of `checklist.ahk` after updating will causes issues after it attempts to update itself*
- Moved the following scripts to `..\Timer Scripts`;
    - `adobe fullscreen check.ahk`
    - `Alt_menu_acceleration_DISABLER.ahk`
    - `autodismiss error.ahk`
    - `autosave.ahk`
    - `gameCheck.ahk`
    - `Multi-Instance Close.ahk`
- Fix all dynamic comments
    - Add markers to all dynamic comments to indicate what type of information needs to be passed for each parameter
- `..\` used in a lot of places now to go back a dir instead of needing hardcoded values
- Added `..\lib\` to reduce the clutter of the root dir
    - Moved the `Functions` & `KSA` folder => `lib`
    - Moved all `checklist.ahk` functions to their own scripts within `\lib\checklist\` to increase readability
        - All functions are now labelled with dynamic comments to explain what they do
- `blockOn()/blockOff()`, `toolCust()/toolWait()` & `coords(), coordw(), coordc()` all changed to class instances =>
    - `block.On()/block.Off()`
    - `tool.Cust()/tool.Wait()`
        - Added `tool.Wait()` to cut repeat code. Makes your script wait for tooltips to finish before continuing
    - `coord.s()/coord.w()/coord.c()`
- Cleaned up & reorganised a ***LOT*** of code to better make use of guard clauses to cut down on stacked `if/else` blocks and make things more readable

## > My Scripts
- Changed `F14::` `show more options` hotkey -> `F18` due to it causing issues with `F14 & WheelDown/WheelUp::`
- `F14 & WheelDown/WheelUp::` now calls `fastWheel()`
- Added the ability to toggle `CapsLock` by double tapping it
- Added `#+^r::` to hard refresh all open `.ahk` scripts (not including `checklist.ahk`)
    - Added `hardReset()` for this and so it can be used elsewhere
- `#+r::` will now create a list of open `.ahk` scripts and tell them to reload instead of requiring hard coded values
    - Will now produce a tooltip while reloading
- `SC03A & c::` now pastes the string instead of using a `Send{}` type to increase performance
- `getMonitor()` in `#c::` now returns a function object instead of a large list of variables
- `#c::` & `#f::` now ignore `checklist.ahk`
- Added `$^f::` for VSCode to automatically highlight the code page before pulling up the search field

## > Functions
- Added `floorDecimal()` to round down after a determined amount of decimal places
- Added `blockOff()` to `getTitle()` and `isFullscreen()` so that in the event they fail, the user is not potentially stuck
- Added a check in `musicGUI()` to make sure to music folder actually exists
- Added `fastWheel()` to replace the simple `SendInput("{WheelDown/Up 10}")` and allow the function to focus the window under the cursor if it isn't currently the active window when called
- Added `detect()` to cut repeat code. Sets `DetectHiddenWindows` & `SetTitleMatchMode`
- Fixed hard coded dir in `switchToDisc()`
- Fixed some incorrect information in `hotkeysGUI()`
- `switchToAE()` now contains more elaborate code to be able to open the `.aep` file for the current Premiere project even once AE is already open
- `activeScripts()` now starts a timer to check the suspended state of `My Scripts.ahk` to update the checkbox value
- Condensed most `OnEvent`'s for `activeScripts()` to one singular function
- `moveXorY()` tooltips will no longer flicker
- `moveTab()` now makes sure the monitor objects have been set 
- Moved `getPremName()`, `getAEName()` & `getID()` => `Windows.ahk`
- `vscode()` now uses no `ImageSearch` and instead uses nothing but hotkeys
- Fixed bug with `updateChecker()` that caused it to set the incorrect ini settings when pressing "Don't prompt again"

`audioDrag()`
- Added more colours
- Will now lower gain before cutting instead of after

`getMouseMonitor()`
- Now returns a function object and passes back all information
- Now `Exit`'s when `try{}` fails to stop potential runtime errors when called and a variable object hasn't been passed back

`tool.Cust()`
- Can now take custom `x` & `y` coordinates. They are unset by default and can be omitted
- Can now accept the `WhichToolTip` parameter from the actual `ToolTip` function
- Tooltip will now follow the cursor if no `x/y` coordinates have been passed to the function
    - Recreating the old way can be achieved with something along the lines of; `tool.Cust("message",,, MouseGetPos(&x, &y) x + 15, y)`
- Timeout variable can now accept `seconds` instead of only `ms` by using a non integer, ie; `2.5` or `0.5`

`zoom()`
- Now sets it's variable presets in an array to remove the need for multiple variables
- Now resets toggle values after 10 seconds

`settingsGUI()`
- Minor GUI tweaks
- Script names are now coloured to make it easier to read
- Fixed bug that caused function to error if non numeric values were entered into the edit boxes
- Now has an option to globally enable/disable reminder tooltips for `checklist.ahk`
- Moved `Current working dir:` to the status bar
    - Status bar now also shows whether `My Scripts.ahk` is active or suspended
- Ability to add game information to `gameCheck.ahk`

## > Other Changes
- Adjusted positioning of tray menu items for `My Scripts.ahk` & `autosave.ahk`
- Added `commLocation :=` to `Keyboard Shortcut Adjustments` for the user to manually input their own commission working dir (if they have one) so my scripts don't need to be hard coded with my own dir
    - `QMK Keyboard.ahk` `h::` now attempts to open `commLocation` if there is no Adobe project open
- Some loops now use `until` syntaxing
- `=>` notation has been used in some places
- Fixed `End::` erroring out if no project is open
- `Keyboard Shortcuts Adjustments.ahk` no longer uses a hardcoded dir for the `location` variable
- Removed `replaceChecklist.ahk` as `checklist.ahk` runs from the root dir now
- All timer scripts that make use of `SetTimer` now have an `OnExit` to stop all timers in the event of a reload/error/new instance
- Changed all instances of `if not x` to `if !x` for consistency

`right click premiere.ahk`
- Now grabs the `x/y` position of the timeline, similar to `mouseDrag()` to allow for;
    - If the playhead isn't within view on the timeline, will no longer input a `shuttle stop` -- this will stop premiere snapping your timeline to the playhead when you activate the macro then causing you to move it to a random location
- Some loops now use `while` syntaxing
- Removed repeat code
- Added a timer that will check for and unstick the `Ctrl/Shift` key
- Made code easier to read & follow
- Will no longer error if `Rbutton::` is just pressed and not held
- Tapping `Rbutton::` will simply move the cursor end the macro

`checklist.ahk`-- Alongside the changes listed above;

    - Create a new checklist
    - Open other checklists
    - Toggle tooltips for the current project (if global `checklist.ahk` tooltips are enabled)
    - Toggle Dark Mode for the current project (if global dark mode is enabled)
    - Display `About` informational GUI
    - Open the current projects log file
    - Open the github repo
    - Show hours worked today, days worked & avg hours worked per day
    - Check for updates on both the stable and beta paths

# <> Release 2.6.1 - Hotfix & QoL
Alongside this release comes the [Wiki Page!.](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/wiki) There you will find documentation for just about everything relating to my scripts!

### Other big changes

- Some scripts now require `AutoHotkey v2.0-beta.12` as a minimum
- Moved; `settingsGUI()`, `musicGUI()`, `hotkeysGUI()`, `todoGUI()` &  `activeScripts()` => `GUIs.ahk`
- Created `tomshiBasic()` which is a simple template for GUIs so I can easily maintain a consistent experience without needing to repeat code

## > Functions
- Added a slight delay to `vscode()` when expanding the `Functions` folder to ensure the right folder is expanded
- `zoom()` tooltip to notify that toggle values have been reset now only appears if the current project has a toggle zoom
- `moveWin()` (when pressing the maximise hotkey) will now check to see if the active window is already maximised, and if it is, unmaximise it
- `updateChecker()` will (while beta update checking is enabled) no longer show the update changelog as the current `dev branch` changelog unless the latest update is actually a pre-release
- `getTitle()` will now ignore ahk GUIs
- Fixed `aetimeline()` & `mousedragNotPrem()` attempting to fire in `Save As` windows
- Add 50ms delay to `movepreview()` to make it more consistent
- Added `refreshWin()` to close & reopen a window to refresh its contents
- `tool.Cust()` will now make sure `WhichTooltip` is an integer between 1-20
- `gain()` & `rgain()` will now make sure the parameter passed is a number
- `disc()` now uses `getHotkeys()` instead of `KeyWait(A_PriorHotkey)`
- Move `On_WM_MOUSEMOVE()` to `General.ahk` to remove repeat declarations

`activeScripts()`
- Now creates it's checkboxes, then uses a loop to attatch the `.OnEvent("Click")` to all of them
- Timer that runs now checks ALL active scripts instead of just `My Scripts.ahk` and updates checkboxes if a script is opened/closed while GUI is open

`settingsGUI()`
- Will now break up toggle checkboxes between general settings and individual script settings
- `undo?` buttons will now follow dark mode settings

> `'Add game to gameCheck.ahk' button`
- Now creates it's own GUI instead of just using an inputbox
    - Allows it to now follow `dark mode` settings
    - Allows this GUI to be called by right clicking on `gameCheck.ahk`
- Window title and Window Process name shown separately instead of combined into the same box
    - Window title will now show in full by default instead of only the first word
- Will now alert the user if adding the requested game was sucessful or not
- No longer copies anything to the clipboard

> `settings.ini button`
- If the user clicks the `settings.ini` button, a timer will now start that will reenable `AlwaysOnTop` for `settingsGUI()` once the user closes the `settings.ini` window
- If the user clicks the button again once `settings.ini` is already open, it will be closed and reopened to refresh the information

## > My Scripts
- All hotkeys that saved the state of the clipboard now save `ClipboardAll()`
- Combined `#+r::` and `hardReset()` into one function => `reload_Reset()` to cut repeat code

`$^f::`
- Now checks to see if you have anything highlighted and won't delete it from the search field if you do
- Now requires `editor.emptySelectionClipboard` to be set to `false` within `VSCode`
    - Added `$^x::` to recreate `VSCode's` typical feature to remove an entire line with `^x` (setting `editor.emptySelectionClipboard` to `false` removes this feature as well)

## > Resolve
- `Rbutton::` now saves the timeline coordinates in a static variable to speed things up *(this forces the need for a reload if the user moves the timeline however)*
- Now uses `getHotkeys()` in place of all `A_PriorHotkey`
- Fixed a large amount of `ImageSearch` logic blocks that I broke with `Release v2.6`
- `rgain()` now returns the original Clipboard once complete
- Updated some images for `Resolve 18.0.4`
- `REffect()` will now more accurately drag the desired effect in more scenarios
    - Will also not attempt to run while Resolve is not maximised and will notify the user

## > Other Changes
- Removed all uses of `verCheck()` and replaced with `#Requires`
- `autosave.ahk` will now attempt to reactivate the original window even if the user interupts the save by interacting with the keyboard
- Moved; `pauseautosave()`, `pausewindowmax()` & `ScriptSuspend(ScriptName, SuspendOn)` to `General.ahk`
- Fix edge case bug of `getID()` not assigning a value and causing an error
- Moved `gameCheck.ahk` game list to `\lib\gameCheck\Game List.ahk`
- Fix `Multi-Instance Close.ahk` starting its timer before the `ms` variable has been set

`checklist.ahk`
- All GUI elements are declared in `construct.ahk` instead of `checklist.ahk`
- Will now apply a dark theme to the menu popouts
- Will now work automatically with `After Effects` projects instead of just `Premiere Pro`
- If `autosave.ahk` attempts to open `checklist.ahk` before the user has opened a project, `checklist.ahk` will now ask the user if they wish to wait until a project has been opened, or if they'd like to manually select the project
    - A new checkbox toggle in `Settings` can force `autosave.ahk` & `checklist.ahk` to always wait for the user to open a project before automatically opening
- If the user clicks the `Open Logs` menu button again once `checklist_logs.txt` is already open, it will be closed and reopened to refresh the information
- Will no longer focus it's window when it initially runs

> `'Check for Updates' menu button`
- If the user has generated a `settings.ini` file, it will now compare the local `Release` version, to the latest release version on github instead of checking the local version of `checklist.ahk`
    - If the user is on a pre-release and then checks for an update in the beta channel, it will then compare the local `checklist.ahk` version to the version on the `dev` branch on github
- If the user hasn't generated a `settings.ini` file, it will now just open the root dir of the repo on github instead of the individual `checklist.ahk` url (now that so many things related to `checklist.ahk` are separated into the `\lib` dir, it makes no sense to point the user to that specific page)

`HotkeyReplacer.ahk`
- All text is centered for a cleaner look
- Now has a `TrayIcon`
- Now shows a progress bar
- Now shows a status bar that updates during the various steps in the process
- Now follows global dark mode settings (defaults to dark mode if no settings.ini file has been generated yet)

`switch code blocks`
- A lot of `if` code blocks have been replaced with `switch` code blocks, eg; 
```autoit
if var = x
    {
        ...
        ...
    }
if var = y
    {
        ...
        ...
    }
```
have been replaced with;
```autoit
switch var {
    case x:
        ...
        ...
    case y:
        ...
        ...
}
```
