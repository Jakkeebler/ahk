# <> Release 2.10 - Settings.ahk, KSA.ahk & HotkeyReplacer.ahk
###### This release contains a lot of underlying refactoring that completely changes large chunks of the codebase.

- Added a new class `Settings.ahk` (#12) that takes complete control over all interactions with `settings.ini`
    - Handles creating `settings.ini` if it doesn't exist yet
    - Moved `createIni()` into `Settings.ahk`
    - `startup.generate()` can now add missing `settings.ini` values

- `Keyboard Shortcut Adjustmenst.ahk` (#13) is now a self contained class that automatically generates variables based on `KSA.ini`
    - Will now alert the user of duplicates
    - `=` can no longer be used as a hotkey within `KSA.ini`

- `HotkeyReplacer.ahk` is now a self contained class (#14) that takes advantages of `Map()'s` to quickly and easily find and replace the user's custom values
    - Has complete feature parity while only needing a fraction of the code
    - Will now only run after a symlink has been properly generated

- Moved `getcmd()` out of `Extract.ahk` and into its own function file

- `dark.allButtons()` can now pass an object to customise the background colours of the GUI/GUI buttons
- `getHTMLTitle()` now uses a `ComObject` to retrieve the url title instead on relying solely on regex

`settingsGUI()`
