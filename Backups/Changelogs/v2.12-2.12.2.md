# <> Release 2.12 - UIA
> #### ⚠️ This release brings *breaking* changes in the way of some `Premiere Pro` functions no longer being as plug and play. Please read the UIA section down below as well as the wiki page to learn more. ⚠️
## > UIA Lib
This update adds the `UIA` lib from [Descolada](https://www.github.com/Descolada/UIA-v2). This library will allow the user to more efficiently interact with panels in `Premiere Pro`. The addition of this library requires some manual tinkering from the user to get going however and means a few Premiere functions are no longer plug and play. Checkout the [wiki page](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/wiki/UIA) for more details on how the library is utilised within this repo, as well as how to adjust the settings for your own setup.

> `Premiere_UIA.ahk` has been added to help with the addition of the UIA lib and is where all variables required will be defined.

## > autosave.ahk Rewritten
`autosave.ahk` has been rewritten from the ground up to follow cleaner coding patterns allowing for easier expandability, easier debugging and allowing the script to do what it was originally designed to do while not encountering issue after issue as more and more responsibilities got attached to the one script.  
The purpose of this update is to smooth out the experience of using the script and allow it to do what it was always supposed to do; do it's thing in the background without interupting the user with countless unrecoverable errors.
> This currently means that `autosave.ahk` will lose the ability to automatically open `checklist.ahk` (as it shouldn't have ever been its responsibility anyway) and will no longer offer a countdown until the next automatic save. The removal of these features has been done after careful consideration to ensure that it doesn't end up in the same pit as before and remains clean and easily maintainable.
>> The settings for these features have currently been disabled within `settingsGUI()` while I decide whether I wish to bring them back in some capacity.



## > Adobe Transition
I am slowly transitioning my `Premiere Pro/After Effects` workflow over to `v23.5` and beyond.
> ⚠️ Code added from this release forward is no longer guaranteed to work on versions `v22.3.1(prem)/v22.6(ae)` as testing will now be conducted on newer releases of the program(s). ⚠️
>> *There shouldn't be much in the way of inconsistencies for the foreseeable future (as almost everything so far has worked in both versions fine) but this is the **offical cutoff point.***

## > Functions
- Fixed `gameCheckGUI {` failing to produce a `Msgbox` to alert the user a game has already been added to the list when the GUI is called from the tray menu.
- Fixed `startup.generate()` incorrectly generating new settings entries
- Added entry `MainScriptName` to `ptf {` so `My Scripts` isn't hardcoded where it doesn't need to be


`switchTo {`
- Fixed `__Win` throwing if target doesn't exist
- Add `adobeProject()` to open the current project in windows explorer.
    - Code taken from `Always.ahk` and replaced with this function
    - Fixed bug in original code that was causing the explorer window to not get focused once opened
- `Explorer()` now includes `"ahk_class OperationStatusWindow"` (ie. transfer graph)

`WinGet {`
- `title()` now has parameter `exitOut` to determine whether the user wishes for the active thread to exit if the function cannot determine the title. Defaults to `true`
- `id()` now returns the `id` on success instead of boolean `true`
- `PremName()/AEName()`
    - Now returns `-1` on failure instead of `unset`
    - Now attempts to determine the `year` value of the open window from the title itself before falling back to `ptf.AEYearVer/ptf.PremYearVer`

`Premiere_RightClick {`
- Fix script stalling if the user attempts to right click anywhere other than the timeline while its coordinates haven't been set
- Add additional colour to fix script failing to work on a target track within `in/out` points
- `checkStuck()` taken out and separated into its own function file

`prem {`
- Fixed `gain()` getting stuck if used multiple times in a row
    - Will also now double check to ensure audio is selected before attempting to open the gain window
- Fixed `getTimeline()` stalling when it encounters an issue
- Added `numpadGain()` which allows `gain()` to quickly be called by pressing <kbd>NumpadSub/NumpadAdd</kbd> followed by any of the <kbd>Numpad</kbd> buttons
- Added `__respondMessage` & `__parseMessageResponse` to allow for scripts to easily share information relating to premiere between one another. (ie. sharing timeline coordinates between scripts)
- Added `searchPlayhead()` to determine if the playhead is within the passed coordinates
- Added `thumbScroll()` to grab the playhead and slowly scrub forward on the timeline
    - Moved some code from `rbuttonPrem {` => `Prem {` to remove the need for repeat code
- `__checkTimelineFocus()` is now static
- `__checkTimeline()` & `getTimeline()` now accept a parameter to determine whether to produce tooltips
- `mousedrag()` now accepts parameter `timeout` to adjust the length of time (in `s`) before the function times out
- `zoom()`
    - Fixed function cycling through timeline sequences if multiple are open
    - Preset zooms can now accept an array length of `5` to include the `Anchor Point` coordinates
    - All tooltips now appear at the bottom of the `Program Monitor` and no longer follow the mouse

## > Other Changes
- Fix `Alt_menu_acceleration_DISABLER.ahk` no longer working as expected in `AHK v2.0.4`
- Added `render and replace.ahk`
- Added `sendtoAE.ahk`
- Added `;vscodeTodoHotkey;`
- Added basic support for `Davinci Resolve v18.5`
- `adobe fullscreen check.ahk` will now work on any version of `Premiere Pro`/`After Effects` and no longer requires the correct year to be set within `settingsGUI()`
- `Multi-Instance Close.ahk` will now ignore `Move project.ahk`
- `checklist.ahk` will now create a `Hotkey` <kbd>Shift & Media_Play_Pause</kbd> to start/stop the timer
- Refactored the following timer scripts;
    - `adobe fullscreen check.ahk`
    - `autodismiss error.ahk`
    - `premKeyCheck.ahk`

`Logs`
- Added the class `log {` to allow for easier logging without the need for an `Error Object`
- `errorLog()` refactored into a `class` (that extends off `log {`) for cleaner code and easier expandability

> These changes do not break prior functionality of `errorLog()` and the only change necessary from a user perspective is adjusting the `#Include` location if used in any custom scripts.

# <> Release 2.12.x -
> ⚠️ This release is a minor hotfix update to `v2.12` which saw massive breaking changes to the repo. If you haven't yet seen the changelog for `v2.12` please checkout those changes [**here**](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/releases/tag/v2.12) ⚠️


## > Functions
- Added `switchTo.PhoneProgs()`
- Fixed `prem.Excalibur.lockTracks()` silently failing if the parameter passed into the function is all lowercase
- `clip.wait()` & `clip.copyWait()` now accept parameter `ttip` to allow for disabling of tooltips on failure. This can be helpful as producing them adds about `100ms` to the total round trip of the function
    - Fixed `discord.surround()` behaving slowly if the user isn't highlighting any text

`cmd {`
- Added `cmd.deleteMappedDrive()`
- `remapDrive()` now has parameter `persistent` to determine whether the user wishes for the desired mapping to remain after system events such as `shutdown`/`restart`


## > Other Changes
- Update discord `Delete` image
- Extended `alt_menu_acceleration_disabler.ahk` changes from last release to all programs listed in `ahk_group Editors`
- `trim.ahk` will now show the currently selected file

`remapDrive.ahk`
- Now has option to delete the currently selected drive letter
- Can now toggle whether the desired mapping is `persistent`

`Streamdeck AHK`

Added;
- `..\download\` `projVideo.ahk`
- `..\lock\` `audio.ahk` & `video.ahk`
- `..\run & activate\` `editing stuff.ahk`
- `frame hold.ahk`

# <> Release 2.12.2 - Hotfix
> ⚠️ This release is a minor hotfix update to `v2.12` which saw massive breaking changes to the repo. If you haven't yet seen the changelog for `v2.12` please checkout those changes [**here**](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/releases/tag/v2.12) ⚠️

## > Functions
- Fix `rbuttonPrem {` throwing while attempting to access a property that didn't exist
- Fix `Premiere_UIA.ahk` throwing if the specific version set within `settingsGUI()` doesn't have a corresponding class (*ie. if the user updates their version of `Premiere` and doesn't set the new version*)
    - The script will now have a `base` class for each main release and then if any individual versions cause breaking changes, a new class can be created that extends off the base
- Pulled code out of `gameCheck.ahk` to create `WinGet.isProc()` that checks to see if a window is a common `windows explorer` element that you may want another piece of code to ignore
- Pulled `drawBorder()` out of `alwaysOnTop()` and placed in its own function
- `prem.numpadGain()` will now wait for a second key to be pressed to allow for double digit inputs. If only a single digit is required, press any other key to continue (ie. <kbd>NumpadEnter</kbd>)
- `switchTo.adobeProject()` now accepts parameter `optionalPath` to navigate to a path other than just where the project file is located

## > Other Changes
- Update `adobeVers.ahk`
- Add `projAudio.ahk`
