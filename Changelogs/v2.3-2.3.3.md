# <> Release 2.3 - Planck Ez Glow + Fix & Feature Update

###### **_Please note: in this changelog I will be linking to commits, these commits might not be the latest version of said code as things are changing all the time and adding dates would get incredibly confusing, don't copy/paste from these linked commits, check out the current version of the code in the script files themselves._**

##### **_Half way through the creation of this release, github stopped accepting new links to shorten through its `git.io` url shortening service so unfortunately I have had to just swap to another service. Continue to not click links if you are against that and just go off final versions as instructed above._**

# Changes
- All EnvSet()/EnvGet() replaced with [`global` variables](https://bit.ly/3frizu7) instead

# <> Release 2.3.1 - Functions.ahk

This release lays the groundwork for a future installer file to work. In the future alongside raw versions of my script will be an installer ahk file that will replace my set hotkeys with your own custom set hotkeys (for `My Scripts.ahk`). By design, it will not work or be available for this version of the scripts, but will *hopefully* be functional and available by the next release.

## > ~~MS_functions~~ Functions
Most functions contained within the MS_functions.ahk file have now been split off into their own ahk files. This file was getting far too large for its own good and it makes sense to separate things out to keep easier track of it all. These new files can be found in the `\Functions` folder in the directory.

- [#1] Created `After Effects.ahk`, `Photoshop.ahk`, `Premiere.ahk`, `Resolve.ahk`, `switchTo.ahk` & `Windows.ahk` to separate out my functions into individual files. These are all then `Include(d)` into the main `Functions.ahk` file 
    - [#1] Renamed `MS_functions.ahk` -> `Functions.ahk`
- Removed the doubling up of code between `switchToMusic()` & `musicGUI()`
    - Adjusted the gui to remove the "default" button so nothing is highlighted when opened

## > My Scripts
- [#3] The Update checker has changed and will not function for this release but will moving forward
    - Update checker now warns the user before downloading the update that if changes have been made by the user, loss of data may occur if they override their scripts with the update folder
    - Update checker will also automatically attempt to backup the users script directory after downloading the latest update

### > Other Changes
- `move project.ahk` now deletes additional residual cache files in your project directory before moving your project
    - it also deletes the files in the `AppData\Media Cache Folder` when the size of the folder is larger than what is set within the code - `15gb by default`
- Added `obs_screenshot.ahk` to quickly activate and screenshot the obs preview window
- Increased the delay for `autosave.ahk` from 5min -> 7.5min
    - Made it easier to customise the amount of time between each save
- Fixed `qss_firefox` scripts so they grab screen coords originally so the mouse returns to the correct position
- Added `convert webm2mp3.ahk` to batch convert `webm` files to `mp3` using `ffmpeg` and `cmd`
    - Renamed `convert to mp4.ahk` -> `convert mkv2mp4.ahk` to fall inline with above
- Update readme

## > Streamdeck AHK
- Added [functions to pause](https://bit.ly/3h0sx6o) both the `autosave.ahk` & `premiere_fullscreen_check.ahk` scripts so they don't try to fire during other scripts

## > Other Changes
- `premiere_fullscreen_check.ahk`
    - Will no longer try to fire on panels/windows that aren't the [main Premiere window](https://bit.ly/3JFhhIW)
    - Checks to make sure the user is [idle on the keyboard](https://bit.ly/3pmiJZl) for 2s before firing
    - Fixed a mistake causing it to only add 1s to the timer instead of 10s
    - Made the frequency the script fires a [user adjustable variable](https://bit.ly/3LDLeei) for convenience

# <> Release 2.3.2 - Error Log

This release brings along the function `errorLog()` that can be used to log instances of a script failing to do what it was supposed to do and append it into a generated `\Error Logs\*.txt` directory/file. Files are sorted by `YYYY_MM_DD_ErrorLog.txt`.

Eg.
```
01:28:31.951 // `^+w` encountered the following error: "Couldn't find the dm button" // Script: `My Scripts.ahk`, Line: 876
13:53:47.797 // `disc()` encountered the following error: "Was unable to find the requested button" // Script: `My Scripts.ahk`, Line: 118
```
# ◇ Further Changelog

## > Functions
- `valuehold()` will no longer work with "any" value panel length and is now hard coded. Allowing it to work across a broader length made it unreliable and more likely to grab the incorrect value. While I do try to make as many functions as possible as flexible as possible, when it comes to this specific function, accuracy is far more important
    - Will now loop searching for the desired property as sometimes it would miss on first attempt
    - Moved some code into a `try{}` `catch{}` combo in an attempt to catch an edge case error
    - Added a `200ms` sleep before moving the cursor back to its starting coords to stop ahk from failing to do so
- `disc()` now loops trying to find the desired button instead of waiting a set `500ms` on initial failure
    - Also loops to try and find the `@ reply ping` button
    - Now has logic to tell if it's in a dm or not so the tooltip about the `@ reply ping` won't fire in a dm
- Moved the remaining functions from `Functions.ahk` to the new `General.ahk` so that I can `#Include` it in all the other function files to make creating and editing functions easier within VSCode

## > My Scripts
- `Alt & p` macro has been updated to function on a newer win11 update (21H2)
- `SC03A & v` macro given more logic as it would constantly fail on first use

## > Other Changes
- `autosave.ahk` changed to function off of a timer instead of sleeps
    - Moved ability to pause `autosave.ahk` back into its own script
- Minor changes to `autodismiss error.ahk` & `premiere_fullscreen_check.ahk` so they aren't constantly spam waiting for their respective windows
- Removed as many hard coded references to `C:\Program Files\ahk\ahk` which is the dir that ***I*** (use to) have these scripts. After this update all you should need to do is change the `location` variable in `KSA.ahk`  & `SD_functions.ahk` and most scripts should function as intended. (*some `Streamdeck AHK` scripts still have hard coded dir's due to filepath limitations*)
- Changed a few `DirSelect` to `FileSelect` with the folder option enabled as they're easier/quicker to navigate

# <> Release 2.3.2.2 - Hotfix
