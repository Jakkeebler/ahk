# <> Release 2.5 - Cleanup & Stability + HotkeyReplacer.ahk
This release is centered around fixing old sloppy practices that have just been left in the code because, *"if it aint broke, don't fix it"*
- Changed all leftover uses of redundant `else if`'s to proper uses of `||` (Mostly a lot of `ImageSearch`'s that were stacked below each other). This helps cleanup repeated code blocks as well as making instances with more than 2 `||`'s more easily readable
- Removed all instances of `%&variableX%` and replaced with `variableX` as the additional syntaxing isn't neccesary for what my scripts do

## HotkeyReplacer.ahk
Alongside the above changes finally comes `HotkeyReplacer.ahk`. The concept of this script was concieved way back in [`v2.3.1`](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/releases/tag/v2.3.1) (6 months ago) originally called `Installer.ahk`. It's designed to read a users local copy of `My Scripts.ahk`, take note of all their custom hotkeys by reading the `;xHotkey;` tags above each one and replacing the hotkeys in the release version. This allows quick transitioning of hotkeys between new versions.

I decided to change the name away from the original concept to `HotkeyReplacer.ahk` in an attempt to cause less confusion for potential new users as being presented with a script called `Installer.ahk` on download that's only useful for someone who *already* uses my scripts is a bit counter intuitive
- This script ***can't*** transfer over new code the user has added. Hotkey tags that aren't in the release version will simply be ignored - some user adjustment will be required in those cases
- To stop it attempting to fire on a random script the user ***must*** still have their script named `My Scripts.ahk`

## > My Scripts
- Added `^+t::` to type out `YYYY-MM-DD`
- All instances of `ClipWait` now have code to fallback on if no data is ever fed to the clipboard.
- Moved discord `F1:: & F2::` code to `discUnread()` to cut repeat code
- Added `A_MaxHotkeysPerInterval := 400` so spamming my unclicked scroll wheel stops creating an error
- Added `SC03A & Left\Right::` alongside `jumpChar()` to jump 10 characters in either direction
- Moved `#F1::` -> `activeScripts()`
- Moved `^+w::` -> `F3::` and with the other discord hotkeys
- `F21::` will now additionally work in windows with `ahk_class #32770` (think "Save As" style windows) instead of just windows explorer
- Checking for updates can now be toggled by right clicking the tray icon

## > Functions
- `updateChecker()` now shows `TrayTip`'s to alert the user that it's downloading the latest release & backing up their scripts
- Replaced `getSecondHotkey()` with `getHotkeys()` to grab both the first and second hotkeys when two are required for activation
- Added `moveXorY()` to easily move the mouse along one axis. This method isn't anything special but useful when you need a quick and dirty way to move along one axis
- `zoom()` will toggle between two options when working on an `Alex` project
    - All variables are now assigned their values at the top of the script for easy adjustment
- `reset()` will no longer reset the track colour
- Removed use of `getClassNN()`. If it failed to grab `classNN` values it would simply pass back unset variables and cause errors
- `getMouseMonitor()` will now only loop as many times as you have monitors
- Removed `toolFind()` and simply added a varibale to `toolCust()` to determine if you want that message at the beginning of the tooltip
- `switchToExplorer()` will now include `Save As` type windows
- Now define `browser & editor` groups in `General.ahk`

`audioDrag()`
- Will now check `A_PriorKey` and if it's a digit, assign that to the track number you wish to move the `bleep` sfx to, instead of checking the state of each individual digit
- Will now present a tooltip showing the user which track it's about to drag to
- Added more colours to reduce the amount of times it will fail
- Shows a count down in the tooltip of how many second remain until the function times out

`isFullscreen()`
- Fixed bug that could cause windows to go full [windows xp lagscreen](https://tinyurl.com/23vobypv)
- Can now have the window you wish to check passed into the function instead of relying on `getTitle()` to grab the active window

`moveTab()`
- Fixed function not working on `monitor 4`
- Will now work even if firefox wasn't already the active window
- Will now check the tab for fullscreen instead of the active window
- Now has more sophisticated code to try and ensure it only grabs a tab
- No longer requires the user to `LButton` to finish the function as it will check for 2s if the user has released the `RButton`

## > checklist.ahk
- Can now manually input minutes to +/- in addition to the preset 10
- `Hours:` number will no longer visually cut off the bottom of the `Time Adjust` group box
- Script version can now be seen in the top right corner
- Less elements have baked in `x/y` values and instead sit relative to their previous elements
- `Title` will no longer create a new line if it's too long
- Minor UI adjustments
- Fixed accompanying `.ini` file being called `checkbox.ini` instead of `checklist.ini`
    - When using `replaceChecklist.ahk` for this version, it will alert the user of the need to replace the `.ini` files
    - Checkboxes are now named in the `.ini` file/code instead of just being `checkbox1-9`
- All checkboxes now call the same function when ticked/unticked

`Logs`
- Replaced wording of opposite logs to be more similar and reduce visual confusion
- Will now group by day to increase readability
    - Will show the hours you started at for each day at the top of the group
- Replaced all wording of `frames` and replaced with `seconds`. Video editor brain let that one slip through the cracks for a bit too long
- Replaced wording `application` with `checklist`
- Fixed the `-sub` & `+add` buttons both using the word `removed` in the logs

`replaceChecklist.ahk`
- Now checks the user's in use version of `checklist.ahk`, compares it to the version in the main script directory and only replaces it if the main version is newer
- Will now prompt the user to select their desired search folder if it doesn't exist and will then permanently overwrite its value

## > Other Changes
- Changed all instances of `errorLog()` initiated via a hotkey to output : `A_Hotkey "::"` instead of just `A_Hotkey`
- Reduced repeat code in `b::` (`QMK Keyboard`)

`autosave.ahk`
- Check frequency changed from `7.5min` to `5min`
- Add a check to make sure `id` variable has been set
- Fixed a bug where timer would not restart if it encountered an error while assigning some variables
- Now uses functions to grab `id & title` information
- Now checks for `ahk_class #32770` which is a secondary window that would stop the user from being able to save
- Added a custom tray menu that when click will show the `min` remaining until a save attempt
- The script will now show a tooltip every minute leading up to the save attempt
    - This can be disabled/re-enable by adjusting a variable in the script or by right clicking it's tray icon and toggling it

`right click premiere.ahk`
- Will now stop playback before attempting to warp to the playhead if it is close to the cursor. This is to prevent the mouse from missing the playhead while trying to warp to it while playback is occuring
- Will now always attempt to swap back to the selection tool incase the user has another tool selected

# <> Release 2.5.1 - HotkeyReplacer.ahk -> KSA + settings.ini
## HotkeyReplacer.ahk
With this release `HotkeyReplacer.ahk` will also replace `Keyboard Shortcuts.ini` entries with the users custom entries. This change allows for a more seamless move between versions for the user as no more manual tinkering is necessary to get up and running (unless you add your own custom shortcuts **or** use `QMK Keyboard.ahk`. There are no plans to add `QMK Keyboard.ahk` to `HotkeyReplacer.ahk` due to it being so highly specific to the keyboard layout of the user).

## settings.ini
Also included in this release is a new `settings.ini` file that is autogenerated in `A_MyDocuments \tomshi\` and acts as a central file to store all data points/settings needed by my scripts to properly function.
- Added `generate()` to do this
    - All instances of `yes/no` used in previous files has been replaced with `true/false` for continuity
    - All old files/dirs used to track things like; `firstCheck()`, `updateCheck()`, `adobeTemp()`, `locationReplace()`, `tooltips - autosave.ahk` will be automatically read before being deleted and replaced with the new `settings.ini`. Your previous settings should be preserved.
