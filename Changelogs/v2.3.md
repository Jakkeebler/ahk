# <> Release 2.3 - Planck Ez Glow + Fix & Feature Update

###### **_Please note: in this changelog I will be linking to commits, these commits might not be the latest version of said code as things are changing all the time and adding dates would get incredibly confusing, don't copy/paste from these linked commits, check out the current version of the code in the script files themselves._**

##### **_Half way through the creation of this release, github stopped accepting new links to shorten through its `git.io` url shortening service so unfortunately I have had to just swap to another service. Continue to not click links if you are against that and just go off final versions as instructed above._**

# Changes
- All EnvSet()/EnvGet() replaced with [`global` variables](https://bit.ly/3frizu7) instead
- Changed all path instances that contained my computers login name `Tom` [to `A_Username`](https://bit.ly/322bkWo) instead for broader compatibility
- Added the `GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3` to the repo
- Added additional comments to most scripts to help explain what's going on

## > QMK Keyboard
- Entire script rewritten as I have upgraded from a tiny 19 key numpad to a 47 key `Planck EZ` *custom keyboard* with custom firmware created by @JivanYatra to simulate what I was doing with the HASU usb->usb convertor
    - All firmware files/contributions from @JivanYatra along with info on how it works can be found in [[\Secondary Keyboard Files]](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/tree/main/Secondary%20Keyboard%20Files)
    - A few macros moved from `My Scripts.ahk` -> `QMK Keyboard.ahk`
- Added [newWin()](https://bit.ly/3A2aLZj) to cut repeat code of running a new instance of a desired program

## > MS_functions

### - fixes/changes
- Further [changes to gain()](https://git.io/JyEtl) to help catch errors
- Fixed [mouseDrag() code](https://bit.ly/3Fsqdil) to completely use variables

- monitorWarp() now moves at [mouse speed `"2"`](https://bit.ly/3GygwR5) as moving across multiple monitors can be a bit finicky at max speed

- Added [fxSearch()](https://git.io/JSJwg) to highlight the effects window in premiere to allow manual searching for effects

## > My Scripts
### - fixes/changes

- `RAlt & p` macro now [resets any changes to the workspace](https://bit.ly/3fsIIsr) so it's always correct
    - it also now [waits for the Import Files](https://bit.ly/3ftMaDb) progress window to disappear before continuing
    - it also grabs the ClassNN value to get the project windows location/dimensions without needing hard coded pixel values
