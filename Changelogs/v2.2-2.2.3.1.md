# <> Release 2.2 - Keyboard Shortcut Adjustments
###### **_Please note: in this changelog I will be linking to commits, these commits might not be the latest version of said code as things are changing all the time and adding dates would get incredibly confusing, don't copy/paste from these linked commits, check out the current version of the code in the script files themselves._**

# Keyboard Shortcut Adjustments
This release brings quick and easy support to adjust keyboard shortcuts within scripts without needing to dig into the code of each individual function or macro. With the addition of [[Keyboard Shortcuts.ini]](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/main/KSA/Keyboard%20Shortcuts.ini) you are able to quickly go in and adjust any keyboard shortcut and have it instantly reflect within any scripts that use it.

Alongside this .ini file is the companion [[Keyboard Shortcut Adjustments.ahk]](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/main/KSA/Keyboard%20Shortcut%20Adjustments.ahk) file which is where we create the values we then later call from within scripts.

So first we define the hotkey within the Keyboard Shortcuts.ini file
```autohotkey
[Premiere]
Effect Controls="^+4"
;[effectControls] (easy searching within Keyboard Shortcut Adjustments.ahk)
```
Then within the Keyboard Shortcut Adjustments.ahk file you'll see;
```autohotkey
effectControls := IniRead("C:\Program Files\ahk\ahk\KSA\Keyboard Shortcuts.ini", "Premiere", "Effect Controls")
```
which we can then call in other scripts like;
```autohotkey
#Include "C:\Program Files\ahk\ahk\KSA\Keyboard Shortcut Adjustments.ahk"
hotkey::
{
    SendInput(effectControls)
}
```

If you were to then go in and adjust the "Effect Controls" value in the ini file to say "^+3" that would automatically follow through to any scripts that call "effectControls"

# Other Changes
## > My Scripts
- Added mouse macros to [skip around in the youtube player](https://git.io/Jgevw)
- Added a macro to [play/pause a youtube video](https://git.io/JVtXi) if your active window is firefox
- [Pull out project window] macro now [highlights/activates](https://git.io/JgTj4) the project window first to ensure it's available
- Added some [mouse wheel macros](https://git.io/JgDFR) to after effects to jump between keyframes
- Moved the [reload macro](https://git.io/J2JEZ) to the main #HotIf and adjusted its activation hotkey so it can be used anywhere
    - It now also [reloads my textreplace.ahk script](https://git.io/J2JEh) (not in [this repo](https://github.com/Tomshiii/textreplace))
- Added a GroupAdd to lump [Premiere & After effects](https://git.io/J2JzC) into a certain #HotIf. Listing them both with an "or" wasn't working for whatever reason
- Removed repeat code from [pull out project window](https://git.io/Ja4lh) macro
- Removed the [old, unconverted code](https://git.io/Ja44Y) that use to sit at the bottom of the script. No need to keep it around anymore

## > MS_functions
- [Improved the functionality](https://git.io/Jzjpj) of psSave(), as well as changing the "pick a destination folder" to an actual windows [pick folder dialogue box](https://git.io/JzjpF)
- Added [aevaluehold()](https://git.io/JgDD7) to bring similar valuehold() functionality to after effects
- [Cleaned up](https://git.io/JgDD3) valuehold() code to cut repeat code
    - Added [opacity](https://git.io/J2kFP) to valuehold()
    - valuehold() also now checks if your [chosen property is already selected](https://git.io/J2kFn) as this would then break the script
    - valuehold() now focuses the timeline and [selects the clip at playhead](https://git.io/JaKCA) just incase
    - valuehold() now [presses Enter](https://git.io/J2Q5E) before warping the mouse back to orign. This is so that on the odd occassion when I hold one of the buttons but don't move my mouse, it doesn't just click on the hovered field and leave it selected and highlighted
- Removed tikproject() and [moved it to a Streamdeck AHK](https://git.io/J2HYz) file
- Changed [manScale -> manInput](https://git.io/J2QDE) to allow for any property to be adjusted using this function
    - Added the ability to [backspace](https://git.io/J2QHB) by pressing the [NumpadDot](https://git.io/J2QyD)
    - Made it also [check for the property being "selected"](https://git.io/JVG8M) similar to valuehold() above
- Removed some [unnecessary variables](https://git.io/JaBuH) from some of the [Resolve functions](https://git.io/JaBzM)
- disc() now imagesearch(es) [around the mouse coords](https://git.io/JaEIW) instead of the entire window.
    - The code that checks for the @ reply ping now only imagesearch(es) when you [press your "reply" macro](https://git.io/Jauoz) and not for any other button
    - Also [searches the entire screen](https://git.io/JaE9q) for the @ reply ping. These make it more functional as it will work regardless of window size or destop resolution
- Fixed a [few mistakes](https://git.io/JaKlO) with rvalhold()
- Added [rgain()](https://git.io/JaKlH) to bring similar function as my premiere gain macros to Resolve. They're not quite as fast as resolve makes things difficult, but still quite useful
- Moved most of the functions from the ["QMK" section](https://git.io/JVG4E) to the [premiere section](https://git.io/JVG4k) since separating them just didn't really make any sense
- Rscale() now [uses imagesearch](https://git.io/JVG4P) instead of raw pixel values

## > Further Tweaks
- Made [Move Project.ahk] check for the capitilisation of the [proxies folder](https://git.io/JgTj8) just incase I create it myself
- Added [New Premiere.ahk](https://git.io/JgD97) to automatically go through the new project process
    - new streamdeck image/backup
- Added some logic to my [streaming script](https://git.io/J2H3A) that will stop it running my automatic mii wii channel points redemption if the full stong is currently playing. It's nothing crazy or incredibly funcitonal, but just bare bones enough to be useful
    - Added [Streaming.ini](https://git.io/J2HGt) to make this work
    - Moved both Streaming.ahk/ini to [\Stream] just to [declutter a little](https://git.io/Ja4Jx)
- Moved ["mouse settings.png", "qmk.psd" & ~~"scripts f keys taken.xlsx"~~](https://git.io/Ja4Jx) to [\Support] Files to declutter a bit
    - [Removed "scripts f keys taken.xlsx"](https://git.io/JVs1C) this excel sheet was originally created to track what F1-24 keys I have in use, the rest of its functionality was tacked on as this repo got bigger and bigger. I'm at the point now where it's too hard to keep track of all the macros I create and listing them in a spreadsheet isn't the most efficient way of visualising it.
- Added After Effects [keyboard shortcuts](https://git.io/JalVb) to [\Backups]
- [Cleaned up syntaxing](https://git.io/JaEUh) in MS_functions.ahk and My Scripts.ahk

- Added [[\Changelogs]](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/tree/main/Changelogs) to keep all changelogs documented without me needing to keep everything in one giant hidden file. (it freaks out with scrolling all the time between the different releases and is incredibly annoying)

# <> Release 2.2.1 - else if {

###### **_Please note: in this changelog I will be linking to commits, these commits might not be the latest version of said code as things are changing all the time and adding dates would get incredibly confusing, don't copy/paste from these linked commits, check out the current version of the code in the script files themselves._**

# else if {
This update is to swap from nested imagesearch(es)/pixelsearch(es) to [consecutive uses of ```else if``` instead.](https://git.io/JojLo) This makes everything far more readable as well as being easier to manage.

Previous;
```autohotkey
If ImageSearch(&xn, &yn, 2148, 116, 2562, 169, "*5 " EnvGet("Resolve") "audio2.png")
    goto rest
else
    {
        If ImageSearch(&xn, &yn, 2148, 116, 2562, 169, "*5 " EnvGet("Resolve") "audio.png")
            MouseMove(%&xn%, %&yn%)
        else
            {
                blockOff()
                return
            }
    }
rest:
```
Now becomes;
```autohotkey
if ImageSearch(&xn, &yn, 2148, 116, 2562, 169, "*5 " EnvGet("Resolve") "audio2.png")
    goto rest
else if ImageSearch(&xn, &yn, 2148, 116, 2562, 169, "*5 " EnvGet("Resolve") "audio.png")
    MouseMove(%&xn%, %&yn%)
else
    {
        blockOff()
        return
    }
rest:
```
While the above isn't too bad to look at either way, consider comparing [this old code](https://git.io/Jojqo) to [this new code](https://git.io/JojmI)

# Other Changes

## > MS_functions
- Added [keyframe()](https://git.io/JKYjd) to quickly turn on keyframe animation/add a new keyframe for a given property in premiere
    - Added [keyreset()](https://git.io/JKYjK) to quickly turn off keyframe animations for a given property
- Added [noclips()](https://git.io/JKOeY) to cut out some repeat code across multiple other functions
- valuehold() now does a [second PixelSearch](https://git.io/Jo9Et) (if the first fails) with a slightly different colour as on rare occassions a longer string of numbers can cause the first attempt to fail.
- youMouse() now reactivates the [previous active window](https://git.io/JoFYV) after skipping in youtube
- Added [monitorWarp()](https://git.io/JKJVu) to cut repeat code in main script
- Cut [repeat code](https://git.io/JKOEq) in vscode()

# <> Release 2.2.2.1 - Hotfix

###### **_Please note: in this changelog I will be linking to commits, these commits might not be the latest version of said code as things are changing all the time and adding dates would get incredibly confusing, don't copy/paste from these linked commits, check out the current version of the code in the script files themselves._**

# Changes
## > MS Functions
- Fixed [autolaunch of Adobe products](https://git.io/JPBbU)

# <> Release 2.2.3 - Dynamic Comments + ahk v2.0beta.3

###### **_Please note: in this changelog I will be linking to commits, these commits might not be the latest version of said code as things are changing all the time and adding dates would get incredibly confusing, don't copy/paste from these linked commits, check out the current version of the code in the script files themselves._**

# Comments
All comments within MS_functions.ahk have been adjusted and rearranged above each function so that VSCode can dynamically take that information and display it on a hover.

For example, the below function will then be displayed as shown when hovered over anywhere in any script it's included in

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53557479/141321985-fc4e9eff-1464-4256-be13-bc50d712cd12.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53557479/141322042-3f33b6dd-b2be-4190-93aa-794a0090ac47.png)

These Dynamic Comments will also extent to all* Keyboard Shortcut Adjustments values.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53557479/141399150-36f63079-0b2b-42ef-877c-fe74fa540882.png)
*Label colours within premiere have not been added

# All Changes
- All Scripts [now require ahkv2.0beta.3](https://git.io/JX5r6) for confirmed compatibility

## > My Scripts
- Add a macro to [open task manager](https://git.io/JXBGN) since microsoft removed it from the taskbar

## > MS_functions
- Adjust all [function comments](https://git.io/JXQJx) to allow VSCode to provide details in their informational popups
- preset() no longer accidentally [deletes clips on the timeline](https://git.io/JXuzy)
- Added [switchtoEdge()](https://git.io/JXXvZ)
- Added [fireWin()](https://git.io/JX1TV) to move around a window while holding it as window snapping in win11 with multiple displays can be a little awkward (especially if you have stacked displays)
- Added [firefoxTap()](https://git.io/JXyVK) to use all of my firefox functions on one button instead of multiple combinations
    - Fixed up switchToOtherFirefoxWindow() as technically most of the code [wasn't actually doing anything](https://git.io/JXyVM)
- All necessary switchto() functions now wait for the program to open before then activating them as win11 opens them in the background
- Fixed the #Include so it's [no longer a full filepath](https://git.io/JX5gb)

## > Keyboard Shortcut Adjustments
- All values now have [comments that explain](https://git.io/JX5uC) what the value is so it can be referrenced anywhere within VSCode

## > Other Tweaks
- [increased the speed](https://git.io/JXBG7) of the qss_...ahk scripts
    - quick sound settings.ahk no longer tries to [activate settings](https://git.io/JXXbb) before it's had time to open

- Updated readme

# <> Release 2.2.3.1 - Hotfix

###### **_Please note: in this changelog I will be linking to commits, these commits might not be the latest version of said code as things are changing all the time and adding dates would get incredibly confusing, don't copy/paste from these linked commits, check out the current version of the code in the script files themselves._**

# Changes
## > MS_functions
- valuehold() now waits for you to [let go of your hotkey](https://git.io/JXACY) if it can't find the property you're looking for. This stops the function from spam activating upon failure causing system slowdown and hangs
- switchtoExplorer() and switchtoExcel() fixed so that you can still cycle between windows that [weren't opened with the hotkey](https://git.io/JXACk)
- audioDrag() will return the [mouse to its original](https://git.io/JXAoj) position if it fails to find what it's looking for
- changed fireWin() -> moveWin() to allow functionality [on any window](https://git.io/JXjAE) for any* program
    - added some extra code to my [F14 win explorer script](https://git.io/JXjA6) to allow this functionality to also work in win explorer without breaking that script
    - now uses [KSA.ahk/ini values](https://git.io/J1e4Y) instead of hard coded values
    - moved position in the script so they don't try to activate within Premiere as they would stop [right click premiere.ahk] from working

## > Other Tweaks
- Added [enable/disable OBS Preview.ahk](https://git.io/J1enF) as obs is run as admin so simple hotkeys can be messy sometimes
    - updated streamdeck backup
- [Fixed [Move project.ahk]](https://git.io/J1veR)
- Updated a few of the Stream related scripts for my own use
