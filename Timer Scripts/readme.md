This dir is a collection of timer type scripts that are all set out to achieve a singular goal

- `adobe fullscreen check.ahk` => There are sometimes where Premiere Pro will put itself in an even more "fullscreen" mode when you lose access to the window controls and all your coordinates get messed up. This scrip is to quickly detect and correct that.
- `Alt_menu_acceleration_DISABLER.ahk` => Disables alt menu acceleration to make using alt in hotkeys more usable
- `autodismiss error.ahk` => Automatically dismisses a certain error within Premiere Pro
- `FuncRedirect.ahk` => A script to include all functions within the other scripts in this directory
- `gameCheck.ahk` => A script to suspend `My Scripts.ahk` when a registered game is the active window and then unsuspend it when it no longer is
- `Multi-Instance Close.ahk` => A script to close any script that has accidently opened another instance of itself
