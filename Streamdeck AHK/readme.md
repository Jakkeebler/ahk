## How To
You launch these scripts individually from a streamdeck (or by using your keyboards custom software to launch programs) to access their macros without needing to clog up a hotkey

"Start x stream" has an exe version so that I can run it as admin locally so it can still interact with obs (as you should be running obs in admin mode). The reason these two require exe's and "Streaming.ahk" doesn't is because these files launch directly from my streamdeck, not via a *RunAs from another script.

Be sceptical of random exe files you find online, feel free to compile them yourself instead using the ahkv2 compiler found : https://github.com/HotKeyIt/Ahk2Exe/tree/alpha
