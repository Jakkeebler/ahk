# ahk

This is a combination of all the scripts I use almost daily to help with either making content (videos or streaming related), or just speeding up mundane random interactions with a computer.

Included is also the Excel document I use to keep track of any hotkeys I set, just as an easier and more visual way of understanding what is/isn't available.

A lot of the code in My Scripts.ahk is either inspired by, or taken from Taran from LTT (https://github.com/TaranVH/). His videos on ahk got me into fiddling around with it myself so many thanks.

You can watch me use some of these scripts in action live while I edit away on  twitch when I stream on my bot account : https://www.twitch.tv/botshiii

## Currently WIP:
- [X] My Scripts.ahk
- [X] scripts f keys taken.xlsx
- [X] random mii wii.ahk (for stream)
- [ ] fkey auto launch (not often)

## Explanation
Item | Use
------------ | -------------
My Scripts.ahk | My main scripts, contains everything I use for stream and editing, as well as a few windows related things I do to speed a few interactions up.
fkey auto launch.ahk | A script from [Taran](https://github.com/TaranVH/) to auto launch OR swap to specific applications if they're already open
Alt_menu_acceleration_DISABLER.ahk | A script from [Taran](https://github.com/TaranVH/) to disable the alt menu acceloration unless you _hold_ down the alt key
autodismiss error.ahk | A script from [Taran](https://github.com/TaranVH/) to remove an annoying dialogue box in premiere that treats you like a child
right click premiere.ahk | A script from [Taran](https://github.com/TaranVH/) to move the playhead in premiere with the right mouse button
scripts f keys taken.xlsx | An Excel doc I use to track all the button combinations used in my scripts so I know what is/isn't available.
random mii wii.ahk | A work in progress script that will tie in with programs from [my brother](https://github.com/timetravelpenguin) to automate a channel points reward on my stream. (this likely has no use case for anyone reading and might be moved to its own repo eventually)
