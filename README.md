# ahk

This is a combination of all the scripts I use almost daily to help with either making content (videos or streaming related), or just speeding up mundane random interactions with a computer.

Included is also the Excel document I use to keep track of any hotkeys I set, just as an easier and more visual way of understanding what is/isn't available.

A lot of the code in My Scripts.ahk is inspired by, or taken from Taran from LTT (https://github.com/TaranVH/). His videos on ahk got me into fiddling around with it myself so many thanks.
