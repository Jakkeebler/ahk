# ahk

This is a combination of all the scripts I use almost daily to help with either making content (videos or streaming related), or just speeding up mundane random interactions with a computer.

Included is also the Excel document I use to keep track of any hotkeys I set, just as an easier and more visual way of understanding what is/isn't available.

A lot of the code in My Scripts.ahk is inspired by, or taken from Taran from LTT (https://github.com/TaranVH/). His videos on ahk got me into fiddling around with it myself so many thanks.
Most of the edits you see will be either be to "My Scripts.ahk" or the "scripts f keys taken.xlsx" excel sheet as they're my own personal works that I tinker with constantly. The other files are just scripts I've gotten from external sources.

You can watch me use some of these scripts in action live while I edit away on my bot account : https://www.twitch.tv/botshiii
