;went through a lot of issues with my pc which basically messed my monitors locations up each time. So now these values are all here so I can easily change them
obsLocation()
{
	if WinExist("ahk_exe obs64.exe")
		WinMove(2553, -936,  974, 1047, "OBS")
}

chatterinoLocationBotshi() => WinMove(3637, 153, 662, 772)

chatterinoLocationTomshi() => WinMove(3648, -398, 832, 586)

streamelementsLocation() => WinMove(3513,  -936, 974, 1047, "StreamElements - Activity feed")

discordlocation() => WinMove(-1080,  -274, 1080, 1600)
